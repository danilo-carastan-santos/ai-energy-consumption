#+TITLE: Requirements: Measuring the energy consumption of AI
#+AUTHOR: Danilo Carastan-Santos

* Hardware Requirements
1) Intel CPU
2) Linux OS (Tested on Ubuntu) with superuser (i.e., ~sudo~) permissions
3) NVIDIA GPU (Not used in the session)

Most energy measurement software rely on Intel's RAPL interface to obtain CPU
and energy data.  In Linux, one way to access the RAPL interface is via the
~powercap~ framework
([[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/power/powercap/powercap.html]]).  For
the hands-on session, you must the able to access RAPL by the following command

#+begin_src bash
sudo cat /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj
#+end_src

The ~sudo~ became necessary as a patch to avoid a security vulnerability with
the RAPL interface
([[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/running-average-power-limit-energy-reporting.html]])

To avoid additional requirements, the session does not cover monitoring the GPU
energy consumption. The way we monitor the energy consumption with CodeCarbon is
the same for CPU and GPU. If you want to use GPUs CodeCarbon only supports
NVIDIA GPUs, and you should be able to run Tensorflow with GPU support
([[https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip]])
